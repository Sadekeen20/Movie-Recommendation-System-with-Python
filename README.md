# Movie-Recommendation-System-with-Python

The procedures are : 
 ->Collect Dataset from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ 
 -> Do an Exploratory Data Analysis
 -> Find the necessity of the rating count as well as the average rating
 -> Do the correlation for a particular movie
 -> Correlation varies from -1 to 1 (the higher the more correlated)
 -> Pick the most correlated and also consider a particular rating count for effective consideration
